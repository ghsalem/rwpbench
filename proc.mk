# sample5.pc illustrates the precompiler part of building a precompiler-forms
# application.  Building the actual executable would require the FORMS bundle.
# Some of the samples require that .sql scripts be run before precompilation.
# If you set RUNSQL=run in your call to make, then make will use sqlplus or
# svrmgrl, as appropriate, to run the .sql scripts.
# If you leave RUNSQL unset, then make will print out a reminder to run the
# scripts.
# If you have already run the scripts, then RUNSQL=done will omit the reminder.

# Here are some rules for converting .pc -> .c -> .o and for .typ -> .h.
#
# If proc needs to find .h files, it should find the same .h files that the 
# c compiler finds.  We use a macro named INCLUDE to hadle that.  The general 
# format of the INCLUDE macro is 
#   INCLUDE= $(I_SYM)dir1 $(I_SYM)dir2 ...
#
# Normally, I_SYM=-I, for the c compiler.  However, we have a special target,
# pc1, which calls $(PROC_64) with various arguments, including $(INCLUDE).  It
# is used like this:
#	$(MAKE) -f $(MAKEFILE) <more args to make> I_SYM=include= pc1
# This is used for some of $(SAMPLES) and for $(OBJECT_SAMPLES).
